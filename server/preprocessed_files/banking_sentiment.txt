AGBA was previously trading as a penny stock from Hong Kong, which saw huge gains after the announcement of the merger, reaching at multiple points roughly twice the PPS that it was at before the recent string of good news (the lowest since April still being an order of magnitude above it's PPS prior to the initial announcement). As a Chinese stock, it's value was mainly propped up by the merger. **AGBA is now domesticating and moving it's headquarters to the USA in Delaware, and as a result is no longer a Chinese company.**

Triller was a private American corporation holding assets such as the **Triller app** (very similar concept to TikTok), Triller TV (a streaming service focused mainly on combat sports), and perhaps most valuable right now, is their majority stake in the **American Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship** (**BKFC**). Based in Philadelphia and founded in 2018, BKFC is the first promotion to hold an official state-sanctioned and commissioned bare-knuckle boxing event in the United States since 1889. **Partly owned by** **Conor McGregor** as of April 2024, it's often claimed to be "the fastest-growing combat sport in the world".

Previous AGBA shareholders received a 30% stake in the combined company, while Triller private investors received the other 70%. Importantly, **there is a 165 day lock-up where that 70% of the outstanding shares cannot be traded.** Furthermore, the stated valuation of the combined company according to the merger agreement is **$4 Billion USD (\~$30 per share) - around eight times it's current value if it is to be believed**.

There is a "strategic partnership" between the merged Triller company and Yorkville (YA II PN, LTD), which will come into effect very soon, the terms of which are shown in this 8-K [here](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001769624/000121390024059262/ea0208930-8k_agba.htm). Yorkville has control of a great deal of shares in the form of convertible debt. This will cause dilution, but it is also suspected that they are planning to leverage their power over the stock price to help pump it up significantly in order to get their money's worth and then some. They have not received any shares yet to my understanding, and are likely still holding down the stock's value to get an ideal entry point for at least a few days post-merger. It's not known with certainty, but it's suspected that Yorkville holds a very large short position on this stock, in part to keep the value down for their entry price, but potentially to also manipulate the value upwards after they buy-in by closing those short positions. This would offset the effect of dilution that their sales would have, and if timed right, may even trigger short squeezing and retail FOMO.

There has also been a great deal of hype regarding a **likely TikTok ban** which may come into effect in **mid-January**. The Triller app being a potential alternative to TikTok based in the USA puts it in a good position for massive growth following such a ban, especially if it can be improved using the combined assets of these merged companies. **Barring any delays, this catalyst would take place within the 165 day lock-up window of 70% of this stock's outstanding shares.**

The combination of these factors could spell out a very significant rally for $ILLR in the near future.

I'm currently holding 746 shares at a $4.95 average. My position has been at a 20-30% profit multiple times within the past couple weeks leading to the merger.

# $ILLR, Title: AGBA & Triller Merger Finalized, Now Trading as a Delaware Corporation Under $ILLR 
Body: Well written
average sentiment: -0.049, Title: Gas prices could rise as much as 47 cents after vote by California regulators 
Body: Another losing position for dems. Why drive up people’s costs?, Title: Gas prices could rise as much as 47 cents after vote by California regulators 
Body: You're being awfully dramatic. You expect to spend a few hundred dollars more a month? If it increased .47c/gal, you would have to use 425 gallons of gas before that cost you $200. If you're driving an average vehicle that gets say 25mpg, you would have to drive over 10,000 miles to burn that much gas.

And that's using the worst case scenario right now that it COULD rise by AS MUCH AS 47 cents/gallon.
