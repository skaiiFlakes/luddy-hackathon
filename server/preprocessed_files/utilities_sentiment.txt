average sentiment: 0.658, Title: Pfizer Investment Analysis: Strong Q3 Performance, Strategic Growth in Oncology and Weight Loss Markets, and High Dividend Appeal for Long-Term Investors
Body: **Summary**

* **Buy Recommendation**: Pfizer shows strong growth potential and income appeal.
* **Q3 Performance**: 32% year-over-year growth with expanding non-COVID revenue.
* **Strategic Focus**: Shifting to oncology and weight loss treatments to drive future growth.
* **High Dividend Yield**: Attractive for income-focused investors.
* **Debt Reduction**: Strengthens financial stability and flexibility.
* **Long-Term Potential**: Diversified pipeline supports growth beyond COVID-related products.

**Introduction & Pfizer’s Q3 Performance**

Pfizer delivered strong third quarter 2024 financial results. According to an article published on Pfizer Investor Insights, “The company reported revenues of $17.7 billion in the third quarter, representing 32% year-over-year growth. Excluding the company’s COVID-19 products, revenues were $13.6 billion, reflecting an operational increase of 14% compared with the prior-year quarter. Third quarter revenue growth was driven primarily by a combination of contributions from Pfizer’s Oncology products, key in-line products, recent commercial launches, as well as heightened demand for its COVID-19 oral treatment. This quarter marks Pfizer’s impressive third consecutive quarter of growth in 2024. Based on the recent quarter performance, the company once again raised its full-year 2024 revenue guidance and adjusted diluted EPS guidance. The company once again increased its full-year 2024 sales projection and modified diluted EPS guidance as a result of the last quarter's success. 

**COVID Franchise & Non-COVID Growth Options**

Pfizer’s current focus on oncology and other rare diseases highlights the transition from its reliance on COVID products. Pfizer must now shift its focus to other areas due to a consistent decline in revenue from its COVID products. According to CNBC, Pfizer’s revenue dropped by 33% in 2023. While people in the market are concerned about Pfizer's post-COVID growth because of the patent expirations and increased competition, Pfizer is addressing these challenges by investing heavily in R&D and strategic acquisitions. Pfizer is also leveraging mRNA technology, proven in its COVID vaccine, for other potential vaccines and genetic treatments to provide further success showing future promise . With a strong balance sheet and a diversified portfolio, Pfizer is focusing to maintain robust growth despite the loss of COVID-related revenue.

**Guidance & Capital Allocation Framework**

Pfizer’s guidance for 2024 project revenues estimates $58.5 and $61.5 billion, reflecting a moderated outlook compared to last year as the demand for COVID-19 products like Paxlovid stabilizes. This outlook shows shifts in COVID-19 product demand, including Paxlovid and Comirnaty, expected to bring in about 8 billion dollars. Despite this, Pfizer’s portfolio is positioned for growth between 8-10% outside COVID-19/pandemic-related products with the recent acquisition of Seagen. Despite decreasing legacy COVID-19 revenues, Pfizer is focused on scaling the oncology, vaccines, and anti-infective products/segments to increase revenue. In cash management, Pfizer is showing a conservative approach, opting not to repurchase shares of 2024 and instead choosing to prioritize their debt reduction with the recent acquisition of Seagen. The company’s $4 billion cost-saving initiative, which is intended to restore operating margins to pre-COVID levels, emphasizes the company’s dedication to increasing profitability even as its expenses rise. This strategy is backed by a very long-standing demand for their products. Which Pfizer expects to leverage for stable revenue growth. Pfizer’s conservative capital allocation strategy shows a balance between reinvesting in growth and maintaining some flexibility to address future operational needs, signaling a focus on performance as the global health markets shift and evolve from a need for COVID-19 products to products focusing on oncology and many other things.

**Pipeline Overview & Oncology Segment**

Pfizer's future expansion is mostly focused upon its late-stage oncology pipeline, especially since buying Seagen in 2023 to expand its targeted cancer therapies and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). ADC Sigvotatug vedotin for non-small cell lung cancer, prostate cancer medicines like PACDEV with KEYTRUDA, and breast cancer medications like abemaciclib and PF-07248144 are important assets. Pfizer expects many regulatory submissions, anticipated peak sales of $10 billion from oncology by the late 2020s, and the further expansion of indications for well-known medications like IBRANCE and 56666 TULISA.

**New Markets: Weight Loss Drugs** 

Pfizer has recently entered the weight loss drug market with Danuglipron, an oral glp-1 receptor agonist whose introduction is well timed as there is increasing demand in the market for prescription drugs for weight loss. Promising results have been experienced in the Phase 2 trials of Danuglipron, which also demonstrated a clinically significant placebo-adjusted loss of weight and ease of tolerating the drug. It remains to be seen whether this high rate of discontinuation of the treatment can be explained entirely by the broad range of gastrointestinal effects experienced. Pfizer has now prioritized a once-a-day modified-release version of Danuglipron that they hope to improve further in 2024. This formulation may lead to increased tolerability and improved patient adherence, hence presenting itself into a market characterized by injectables. In comparison to Eli Lilly's oral candidate and Astra's lower-rate offering, Pfizer hopes to launch funnel and Danuglipron in the next few years. Demand for weight loss medications is presently quite high owing to growing understanding of obesity's accompanying health threats as well as better treatment options resulting in considerable growth potential within the market. If approved, Danuglipron could offer a major source of revenue and allow time-poor patients a simpler oral method of taking GLP-1 medications , which represents a new strategy for companies like Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, who currently lead in the market. 

**Capital Allocation & Debt Reduction Strategy**

In Pfizer’s strategic shift toward long-term growth, capital allocation and debt reduction have become critical focal points. Following its recent acquisition of Seagen, Pfizer has prioritized lowering its debt, demonstrating a cautious approach to capital management. Rather than share repurchases, Pfizer has opted to channel resources into reducing its debt burden, a move designed to strengthen its balance sheet and enhance financial flexibility. This approach is supported by the company’s $4 billion cost-saving initiative aimed at improving operating margins, which aligns with the goal of achieving greater profitability in a post-COVID revenue landscape. By prioritizing debt reduction, Pfizer not only bolsters investor confidence but also positions itself to reinvest in key growth areas, especially in oncology and other high-potential therapeutic areas.

**Dividend Policy and Shareholder Returns**

In Pfizer’s most recent quarterly report, they expressed their goal of bolstering the shareholder value as much as possible. They prioritize increasing the number of share buybacks, reducing the company’s debt, and improving the value of their dividends. Dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividends per share by the price of the shares. This metric communicates what percentage of the share price the dividend is. A higher dividend yield indicates that the company's dividends are worth the share's price. Pfizer’s current dividend yield is 6.00%, which is higher than average. As of the YTD, the annual dividend is $4.96, and the dividend of the recent quarter is $0.42. In the past two quarters, Pfizer has spent $273.04 on share buybacks. These share buybacks increase the value of a Pfizer share which benefits current investors. Based on recent company goals, the amount of shares repurchased by the company will increase. Investors can maximize their profit by investing as soon as possible, as Pfizer’s dividend policy benefits income investors due to the dividends the company distributes each quarter. When compared to peer companies like Johnson and Johnson, Novo Nordisk, and AbbVie Inc, Pfizer has the highest dividend yield and payout ratio, making it the optimal company to invest in.

**Research and Development Focus in Oncology**

Pfizer’s oncology efforts are led by innovative treatments such as Elranatamab, known as Elrexfio. Approved last year, Elrexifo targets patients that suffer from a rare and incurable blood cancer that affects myeloma cells. This disease currently impacts around 160,000 people worldwide and accumulates around 34,000 new diagnoses annually in the U.S. alone. Elrexifo aims to extend the amount of time patients have before their condition worsens. According to The Independent, the treatment was recently endorsed by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK. It is estimated by NICE themselves that about 700 people will benefit from this recommendation. It will only help a handful of patients because of the restrictions that reduce accessibility, however, efforts are underway to broaden its reach. Globally, Elrexifo is a key contributor of Pfizer’s projected oncology sales, which totaled over $12 billion in 2023. So far, their oncology revenue, combined with that of non-COVID products, has totaled over $13.6 billion in Q3 2024. These products are seeing a growth rate of 14% compared to last year. Aside from Elrexifo, Pfizer also intends to boost its oncology sector by investing in next-gen cancer therapies like immuno-oncology, further researching potential cancer treatments, and striking partnerships with biotech firms. These factors suggest a promising future for Pfizer’s role in oncology, making the company a compelling investment opportunity going forward, even with COVID out of the picture.

**Competitive Landscape in Weight Loss Market**

Pfizer’s entry into the weight loss drug market with Danuglipron provides it with a foothold against key competitors like Eli Lilly. Danuglipron’s oral formulation offers a unique advantage in a field dominated by injectables, potentially boosting patient adherence. While competitors like Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk hold substantial market shares, Pfizer's innovation in GLP-1 delivery could capture significant demand, especially if its modified-release formulation proves successful.

**Profitability Metrics & Investor Appeal**

Pfizer’s profitability metrics reveal a mixed picture for long-term investors. While its gross profit and operating income are substantial, translating into a gross profit of $42.68 billion this year with a $4.2 billion net income, profitability ratios such as ROE (declining at 28%) and ROIC (14%) signal potential weaknesses in value generation for shareholders. Additionally, Pfizer’s profitability score is a modest 58/100, trailing behind competitors like Johnson & Johnson, Roche, and Eli Lilly, which have higher scores and better net income margins despite lower gross profits. Pfizer’s EBITDA margins reflect solid cash-generating ability, but declining profitability metrics suggest a need to boost efficiency or reduce costs to enhance returns. Pfizer’s forward dividend yield, which appeals to income-focused investors, remains a strong draw, yet the declining ROE and ROIC may lessen its attractiveness as a sustainable long-term investment compared to its more efficient peers.

**Valuation Analysis**

Two factors that can be used to conduct an in-depth analysis for the valuation of Pfizer are forward EBITDA and PEG ratios. These can be used to compare Pfizer to industry standards. Currently, their EBITDA margin benchmark against competitors is 30.7%. Pfizer is relatively higher compared to industry standards, emphasizing strong profitability. Additionally, Pfizer’s PEG ratio is 1.47. Compared to industry standards, Pfizer is well exceeding in this category reflecting how it could be potentially overvalued. Therefore, their current valuation reflects strong growth potential according to EBITDA but questionable growth potential according to PEG ratios. In addition, Pfizer’s stance in the healthcare industry allows them to dominate but also provides risks as their COVID-19- revenue is slowly declining. Ultimately, Pfizer's strong EBITDA margin and dominant industry position make it a unique portfolio addition, as it offers stability and growth potential despite concerns over COVID-19 revenue decline and a high PEG ratio.

**Conclusion: Investment Thesis/ TLDR**

Buy: Pfizer’s strong Q3 growth, high dividend, and strategic focus on cancer and weight loss treatments make it a stable, income-friendly investment with solid long-term potential.

Body: Sorry if I am off-topic, I am new to this world and to get feedback I had to start somewhere (send me to the proper subreddit if I'm wrong).

I have just finished reading The Misbehaviour of Markets by Mandelbrot, and I immediately started looking for libraries in Python to do data analysis using his suggested metrics.

To my surprise, I couldn't find any. So, first question, did I not search properly? What do you use?

Therefore, I started developing mine :)  
But I am having problems with the Hurst exponent/scalability (it is utilized to evaluate the extent of long-term reliance in market predictability), I don't understand how to interpret the results or there is a bug in the code (less likely, or in the data).

So, I really do not understand why assets that behave like roller coasters (e.g., BTC-USD)  have these scale factors. Shouldn't they be extremely high?

average sentiment: 0.445, Title: High Yield Corporate Debt Opportunities 
Body: Aging population is a powerful theme but it is not a catalyst. People have been investing on this theme for 20 years and there aren’t any new surprises coming up. It is very, very priced in to everything., Title: High Yield Corporate Debt Opportunities 
Body: Hello All - I am interested in high yield corporate bonds that have potential upside. Any ideas here come to mind? Please also state what the drivers of that upside would be.

A few ideas that come to mind are Owens and Minor and Medlife. I am generally kind of bullish on the medical supply chain / supply industry but also curious regarding your industry ideas.

Main drivers on my end are possible credit upgrades and macro factors such as increased demand due to aging population but again curious if anyone thinks other industries or CUSIPS make sense.
average sentiment: 0.416, Title: Choosing Fidelity 401k help! 
Body: Some target date funds have quite reasonable fees - Vanguard's are at 0.08%, and the Fidelity index ones are 0.12%.

Ishares also has an ETF version with a 0.11% fee., Title: Choosing Fidelity 401k help! 
Body: The Fed is short for "Federal Reserve", not an acronym, and doesn't need to be set in all-caps. Initialisms which may be appropriate depending on the context include "FRS" for "Federal Reserve System" or "FOMC" for "Federal Open Market Committee".

average sentiment: 0.308, Title: NVDA To Join Dow Jones Industrial Average
Body: If you have any type of S&P 500 index or growth fund, you invested in nvda., Title: NVDA To Join Dow Jones Industrial Average
Body: This seems like such a classic example of buying high and selling low.

I have no idea why Intel wasn't booted years ago. But putting NVDA in now jut seems nuts, especially since the DOW is typically supposed to be safe and relatively stable blue chip stocks, which NVDA isn't.

average sentiment: 0.099, Title: What does it mean when a stock price is N/A and why am I not allowed to trade a stock?
Body: There is usually a deadline with warrants to either exercise them (turn in your warrants plus cash and buy shares) or sell them. After the deadline they are worth $0, Title: What does it mean when a stock price is N/A and why am I not allowed to trade a stock?
Body: I've had stock that became worthless in bankruptcy where the company went out of business.  In that case the procedure to write off the stock was to contact my brokerage (CS)  and fill out some forms saying I surrendered the stock.  After that point I had no claims to anything that might result from intellectual property payments or the like.

I'd send a message to CS and ask about the stock and warrants.
