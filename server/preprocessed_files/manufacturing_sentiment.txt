average sentiment: 0.628, Title: Arcane Season 2 smashes Netflix charts & becomes most popular show in over 60 countries
Body: How did everyone enjoy the first 3 episodes so far? For me, I like that they got right into the action scenes early on but overall I feel like the plot is kind of slow right now, and not much is really happening., Title: Arcane Season 2 smashes Netflix charts & becomes most popular show in over 60 countries

average sentiment: 0.566, Title: Olivia Rodrigo on Netflix Concert Film and Voting In Her First Presidential Election: “It Couldn’t Be More Important”

Body: I really wish more artists would do this too. Preserves the show forever for all of us.
average sentiment: 0.462, Title: Daniel Craig calls on Netflix to release 'Knives Out 3' in cinemas
Body: I’d be happy if they just released them on Blu-ray. I don’t particularly feel the need to subscribe to a service just to watch a particular movie., Title: Daniel Craig calls on Netflix to release 'Knives Out 3' in cinemas
Body: The second one, like other Netflix movies, plays in a very limited amount of theater(s) solely to qualify for awards. It didn’t release wide like the first one did.
average sentiment: 0.293, Title: “Hate”: Martha Stewart trashes Netflix’s new “Martha” documentary
Body: She’s the original haughty, WASP-y, cold, denying, perfectionist Grandma Kween and I love her for it, Title: “Hate”: Martha Stewart trashes Netflix’s new “Martha” documentary

average sentiment: 0.172, Title: Alicia Keys, At Kamala Harris Rally, Says Trump Platform Would Roll Back Women’s Rights: “This Is Not Some Dystopian Netflix Show I’m Talking About”
Body: >“If you don’t vote for her, or you don’t vote at all, you’re voting for the chaos and the hate,” she told a rally in Montgomery County, PA, where she was appearing with former First Lady Michelle Obama.



>“You’re voting for a cruel tomorrow for immigrants, people of color, women, girls, our children and our planet,” she said.



>She added, “It’s crazy because too many people think women can’t lead just because they haven’t seen enough of it. When our kids look around their classrooms at the pictures of presidents on the wall, every single one is a man, one Black guy. No wonder it is hard for many to imagine a female president. They have never seen one, and if they can’t see it, how can they believe it?”



>Keys noted that women “had reproductive freedom, but not so much now, and that’s why we’re still fighting today. That’s why we can’t get comfortable, because they’re already starting to take those rights away. If it’s been done already with Roe. vs. Wade, what makes us think that there couldn’t be a leader in place for the other side that would say, ‘Forget equal pay. Women don’t need it. Or, ‘We don’t need to educate women anymore. They can just stay at home. They don’t work anyway.'”



>She added, “This is not some dystopian Netflix show that I am talking about. This is like the platform the other side is running on. They want to turn back the clock.”, Title: Alicia Keys, At Kamala Harris Rally, Says Trump Platform Would Roll Back Women’s Rights: “This Is Not Some Dystopian Netflix Show I’m Talking About”

Body: Cancel your subscription then. Money is the only language companies understand, Title: Netflix likely to announce new price increase soon, analysts predict

average sentiment: 0.027, Title: ‘Back in Action’ Trailer: Cameron Diaz Ends Her 11-Year Acting Retirement by Teaming Up With Jamie Foxx for Netflix’s Spy Movie

Body: I do this with YouTube and podcasts all the time. Not brave enough to do this with a show with actual production quality though., Title: Monsters walk among us — and they're watching Netflix at 1.5x speed
Body: I'll never understand this. 

I can only speak for myself--- I struggle to follow media with the 'internet editing' of it all, when people cut out every single pause as they take a breath between words and when they use jump cuts to finish sentences.  Maybe my brain works differently. But no one should be watching movies or tv fast like this. What in the hell?
